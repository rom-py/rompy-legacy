    # Rompy Notebooks

    This repository contains example notebooks and tutorials for the rompy ecosystem.

    ## Requirements

    Install the required rompy packages:

    ```bash
    # Core package (always required)
    pip install rompy

    # Optional plugins (install as needed)
    pip install rompy-swan      # For SWAN wave modeling
    pip install rompy-schism    # For SCHISM modeling
    ```

    ## Notebooks

    - Browse the notebooks/ directory for examples
    - Each notebook includes setup instructions and explanations
    - Notebooks are organized by plugin/functionality

    ## Plugin-Based Examples

    The notebooks demonstrate rompy's plugin architecture:
    - **Core examples**: Basic rompy functionality
    - **SWAN examples**: Wave modeling with SWAN (requires rompy-swan)
    - **SCHISM examples**: SCHISM modeling (requires rompy-schism)
    - **Integration examples**: Using multiple plugins together

    ## Contributing

    Please see the main rompy repository for contribution guidelines.

# Git settings
git:
  # Branches to include in split (empty means all branches)
  branches: []
  # Tags to include in split (empty means all tags)
  tags: []
  # Whether to rewrite commit messages
  rewrite_messages: false
  # Author rewriting (if needed)
  author_rewrites: {}
# Usage Instructions:
#
# 1. To use this enhanced configuration with cookiecutter integration:
#    python split_repository.py --config repo_split_config_with_cookiecutter.yaml
#
# 2. To use without cookiecutter (fallback to original behavior):
#    Comment out the "apply_cookiecutter_template" actions above
#
# 3. To use a different cookiecutter template:
#    Update the template_repo paths in the actions
#
# 4. To customize the project structure:
#    Modify the template_context values for each repository
#
# Benefits of cookiecutter integration:
# - Consistent project structure across all split repositories
# - Modern Python packaging best practices
# - Pre-configured entry points for plugin discovery
# - Standardized CI/CD, documentation, and testing setup
# - Easy to maintain and update project templates
#
# The merge strategy options:
# - "overlay": Cookiecutter files take priority, but preserve git history and code
# - "replace": Use cookiecutter structure, preserve only git history
# - "preserve": Only add missing files from cookiecutter, keep all existing files
