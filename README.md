# Introduction

Relocatable Ocean Modelling in PYthon (rompy) combines templated cookie-cutter model configuration with various `xarray` extensions to assist in the setup and evaluation of coastal ocean models, and is intended to simplify their configuration, execution and analysis. This repository also includes [Jupyter notebooks](./notebooks) that provide examples to illustrate the use of `rompy` code, create visualisations and provide inline documentation. Currently `rompy` implements one model class for the [SWAN wave model](https://swanmodel.sourceforge.io/) developed by Delft University of Technology. Work is underway on a lightweight wrapper for SCHISM and XBeach.
